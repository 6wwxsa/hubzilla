<div class="tr" style="font-size: 1.6em; color: #666; margin-left: 75px; margin-right: 75px;">
The RedMatrix (aka "red") is a highly advanced social networking platform which was created by a <a style="color: #555;" href="#" class="cb">farmer in Australia</a> - that grew disgusted by the lack of privacy and the increasing tendency of foreign corporations and governments to monitor and control the internet. This has  strangled and subverted all that was once good about the web - and turned it into a "steaming pile of crap". (Aussies typically don't mince words.) 
</div>
<br />
<div class="tr" style="font-size: 1.6em; color: #666; margin-left: 75px; margin-right: 75px;">
Working with a team of volunteers from six continents and over a period of several years, this has emerged into something quite spectacular. It's an open source, decentralised identity and sharing system which brings back some semblance of privacy to a world that desperately needs it - today more than ever. It's a webserver platform not much more complicated than a WordPress blog and using the same technology, but thousands of times more capable in what it can do for your social communications and sharing needs.   
</div>
<br />
<div class="tr" style="font-size: 1.6em; color: #666; margin-left: 75px; margin-right: 75px;">
Taking cues from life in the Aussie outback, the Red Matrix has no central authority. Each channel (or social profile) is independent and autonomous - and controls its publishing privacy as the owner see fit. Some will want more privacy, some less. They can do this, as unlike your typical social network - the matrix has no say in their decision and cannot subvert it. Server hubs are self-sufficient and the network will continue to function if any single node in the matrix goes offline. It also provides channel resilience. You can "clone" your channel (or social profile) to any hub in the network and carry on without interruption if your primary server "chucks a wobbly" for an hour - or a week. (No fail whale needed here.)

To be fair, this Aussie farmer knows more about communications and web software than most professional developers. He's a somewhat respected internet pioneer who once worked for American corporate giants as a web communications and protocol wizard  - and has returned from semi-retirement to try and save the web from what is has now become.
