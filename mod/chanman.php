/**
	Placeholder file at present. This is going to involve a bit of work.

	This file will deal with the deletion of channels and management of hublocs.

	We need to provide the following functionality:

	- Delete my account and all channels from the entire network

	- Delete my account and all channels from this server

	- Delete a channel from the entire network

	- Delete a channel from this server

	- List all hub locations for this channel

	- Remove this/some hub location from this channel

	- promote this/some hub location to primary

	- Remove hub location 'xyz' from this channel, (this should possibly only be allowed if that hub has been down for a period of time)

	- Some of these actions should probably require email verification
