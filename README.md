Make Hubz with Hubzilla
=======================

**What are Hubz?**

Hubz are general-purpose websites built with **Hubzilla**. Every website member can create their own unique website or social space to suit their needs and personality, and these can all share and interact.

But we don't stop there. Hubz all over the internet "magically" connect together into very large (or "internet-scale") social networks, websites, and communities; and *these* can all share and interact. 

When connected with other Hubz, permission to access the things you publish can extend to anybody in the Hubzilla network. So *my* Hubz can easily and securely (and "magically") share private stuff with *your* Hubz. Photos, spreadhseets, web pages, anything - anybody. This does not require another account or a password to access the private stuff. 


**Hubzilla** is open source and built on PHP/MySQL/Apache (Mariadb or Postgres and Nginx could also be used, we're pretty easy).  

Hubz are

* decentralised
* social
* privacy-enabled (privacy exclusions work across the entire internet to any registered identity on any compatible Hubz)
* optionally inter-networked with other hubs

Possible website applications include

* decentralised social networking
* personal cloud storage
* managing organisational communications and activities
* small business websites
* public and private media/file management and access
* blogs
* event promotion
* feed aggregation and republishing
* forums
* pretty much anything you can do on a traditional blog or community website, but that you could do better if you could easily connect it with other websites.


Hubzilla members can also interact to varying degrees with several independant social networks such as Diaspora, Redmatrix, and Friendica; and can cross-post published items to a large number of other social and communication providers via plugins.
