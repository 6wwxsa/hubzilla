Make Hubz with Hubzilla
=======================

![Hubzilla](images/ghash-32.png)

**What are Hubz?**

Hubz are general-purpose websites built with **Hubzilla**. Every website member can create their own unique website or social space, and these can all share and interact.

Hubz all over the internet "magically" connect together to create very large social networks, websites, and communities; and *these* can all share and interact. 

Members of *my* Hubz can easily and securely share stuff with members of *your* Hubz. Anything with anybody. Publicly, or **privately**. 


**Hubzilla** is open source and built on PHP/MySQL/Apache (Mariadb or Postgres and Nginx could also be used, we're pretty easy).  

Hubz are

* decentralised
* inherently social
* optionally inter-networked with other Hubz
* privacy-enabled (privacy exclusions work across the entire internet to any registered identity on any compatible Hubz)

Possible website applications include

* decentralised social networking nodes
* personal cloud storage
* file dropboxes
* managing organisational communications and activities
* collaboration and community decision-making
* small business websites
* public and private media/file libraries
* blogs
* event promotion
* feed aggregation and republishing
* forums
* dating websites
* pretty much anything you can do on a traditional blog or community website, but that you could do better if you could easily connect it with other websites or privately share things across website boundaries.
