Hubzilla - Hub Deployment Platform
==================================

**What are Hubs?**

Hubs are general-purpose websites. You can decide what you want them to do. These may have one or more members. Every hub member can create or customise their own "channels", which are personal websites, forums, media collections, and/or social spaces within the hub, and these can all share and interact. 

Hubs and their members from all over the internet connect together "magically" to create very large communities and social networks; and *these* can all share and interact. 

Hub members can securely and privately share anything; with anybody, on any hub - or share stuff publicly with anybody on the internet if desired. 


**Hubzilla** is the server software which makes this possible. It consists of an open source content management system combined with a decentralised identity, communications, and permissions framework and protocol suite, built using common webserver technology (PHP/MySQL/Apache, although Mariadb or Postgres and Nginx could also be used - we're pretty easy). The end result is a level of systems integration, privacy control, and communications features that you wouldn't think are possible in either a content management system or a decentralised communications network.

Hubzilla hubs are

* decentralised
* inherently social
* optionally inter-networked with other hubs
* privacy-enabled (privacy exclusions work across the entire internet to any registered identity on any compatible hubs)

Possible website applications include

* decentralised social networking nodes
* personal cloud storage
* file dropboxes
* managing organisational communications and activities
* collaboration and community decision-making
* small business websites
* public and private media/file libraries
* blogs
* event promotion
* feed aggregation and republishing
* forums
* dating websites
* pretty much anything you can do on a traditional blog or community website, but that you could do better if you could easily connect it with other websites or privately share things across website boundaries.
