Make Hubz with Hubzilla
=======================

![Hubzilla](images/ghash-32.png)

**What are Hubz?**

Hubz are general-purpose websites. Every member can create or customise their own personal websites, media collections and/or social spaces, and these can all share and interact.

Hubz all over the internet connect together "magically" to create very large communities and social networks; and *these* can all share and interact. 

Hubz members can securely and privately share anything; with anybody, on any Hubz. Or share stuff publicly with the entire internet if desired. 


**Hubzilla** is open source and built using common webserver technology (PHP/MySQL/Apache, althogh Mariadb or Postgres and Nginx could also be used, we're pretty easy).  

Hubz are

* decentralised
* inherently social
* optionally inter-networked with other Hubz
* privacy-enabled (privacy exclusions work across the entire internet to any registered identity on any compatible Hubz)

Possible website applications include

* decentralised social networking nodes
* personal cloud storage
* file dropboxes
* managing organisational communications and activities
* collaboration and community decision-making
* small business websites
* public and private media/file libraries
* blogs
* event promotion
* feed aggregation and republishing
* forums
* dating websites
* pretty much anything you can do on a traditional blog or community website, but that you could do better if you could easily connect it with other websites or privately share things across website boundaries.
