Make Hubz with Hubmaker
=======================

**What are Hubz?**

Hubz are independant webservers which can seamlessly connect together to share stuff. 

Each hub can be operated standalone (like a blog) or as a webserver community (like a forum or social network). Hubz can be large or small. They can also operate isolated or as connected hubz. When connected they form a super-network of hubz where any member can easily share and interact with any other member or members of any connected hubz. 

When connected with other hubz, access permissions of anything published on an individual hub extends to the rest of the network, so that a member of *my* hub can easily and privately share something with a member of *your* hub. They do not require an account or password on my hub to do this. It just works. 

**Hubmaker** is the software which creates and manages hubz. It is open source and built on PHP/MySQL/Apache (Mariadb or Postgres and Nginx could also be used, we're pretty easy).  

Each hub is

* decentralised
* social
* privacy-enabled (privacy exclusions work across the entire internet to any registered identity on any compatible hub)
* optionally inter-networked with other hubs

Possible applications include

* decentralised social networking
* personal cloud storage
* used like a traditional content management system or community website
* managing organisational communications and activities
* small business and outreach websites
* public and private media/file management and access
* blogs
* feed aggregation and republishing
* forums
* pretty much anything you can do on a traditional blog or community website, but that you could do better if you could easily connect it with other websites.


Hubz can also interact to varying degrees with several independant social networks such as Diaspora, Redmatrix, and Friendica; and can cross-post published items to a large number of other services via plugins.
