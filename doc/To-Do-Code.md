Project Code To-Do List
=======================

We need much more than this, but here are areas where developers can help. Please edit this page when items are finished. Another place for developers to start is with the issues list.


* ACL widget - provide cc/bcc toggle to allow recipients to be discoverable at receiving end. This should integrate with public/private collections which currently exist but have no defined function.

* Documentation - see [Red Documentation Project To-Do List](help/To-Do)

* Finish the anti-spam bayesian engine

* Write more webpage layouts

* Write more webpage widgets 

* (Advanced) create a UI for building Comanche pages

* Help with WebDAV and file storage implementation

* Extend WebDAV to provide desktop access to photo albums and existing file (attachment) storage

* Directory - provide a hover popup providing much more detail about the channel of interest. Keywords, additional public profile details, perhaps the last public post, anything else of interest. 

* Events module - bring back birthday reminders for friends, fix permissions on events, and provide JS translation support for the calendar overview

* Events module - event followups and RSVP

* Photos module - turn photos into normal conversations and fix tagging

* Provide RSS feed support which look like channels (in matrix only - copyright issues)

* Fully implement "things".

* Activity Stream generation for liking things, liking channels and other combinations.

* Implement owned and exchangeable "things".

In many cases some of the work has already been started and code exists so that you needn't start from scratch. Please contact one of the developer channels like Channel One (one@zothub.com) before embarking and we can tell you what we already have and provide some insights on how we envision these features fitting together.
