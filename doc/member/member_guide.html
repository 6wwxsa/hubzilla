While many features and capabilities of Hubzilla are familiar to people who have 
used social networking sites and blogging software, there are also quite a few new
concepts and features that most people have not encountered before. Some of the 
new ideas are related to the <strong>decentralized</strong> nature of the grid; others are associated
with the advanced <strong>permissions system</strong> that is necessary to protect your data privacy.
